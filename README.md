# Twilight - Timezone Tracker

## Overview

Personalise your timezones with the ability to time travel! 🕓

## Description

Twilight is a timezone tracking app that makes convert time fun like a fidget spinner. You can easily add fun little nicknames to your locations and travel ahead in time to settle on your next
gaming session!

**a) Customisable Names**

💬 Do you have friends and family that lives in different countries with annoying timezones and you always have trouble knowing whether it is night time at their local time or not?

Fret not! Now, you can have their timezones all in one place with fun little names (optional).

You can just easily add them as:

- “Little Simba 😸”
- “Eggs and Ham 🥚”
- “My Little Princess

💬 Do you work remotely with team members from all around the world and always a pain to setup a meeting time based on everyone's local time?

Sure, you can just Google their local time. But, think about the amount of letters you have to type everytime!

You can just easily add them as:

- "London's Office 🇬🇧"
- "Munich Drinking Buddies 🇩🇪"
- “Japan Animation Team 🇯️🇵️”

**b) Time Travel with the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey Spinner**

💬 Yes, you've read that right! You can now travel ahead of time and see what time is it going to be. (Mind blowing, I know).

The measuring tape looking slider, give that a spin and it will transport you through time. You can instantly see the local time of your saved timezones and how they fare up. Then, you can finally make a call with that one of friend of yours without accidentally waking them up.

**c) Dark Mode**

Although the name of the app is Twilight, but we do support both Light and Dark mode. All spectrum of light deserves the same amount of love and attention.

If you made it this far in the description, thank you for your support! Timezones is always been my arch enemy, next to math and physics. Would love to hear about what you think about the app!

In the meantime, go time travel!
